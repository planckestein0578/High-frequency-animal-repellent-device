# High-frequency-animal-repellent-device
This is a repository consisting of codes and another stuffs related to HF animal repellent device.

I have made this project due to a trauma I have experienced.
I had experienced many stray dog chases and also possible rabid dog attack. 
Thankfully I am safe, and this device helps to repel these kinds of animals away.
i have tested it and it certainly works.
Please use it causiously....
